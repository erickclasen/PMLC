Perceptrons, untrained, hand picked weights and biases.

or_sigmoid.py - Sigmoid neurons simulating perceptrons, part II http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html
                worked out the consequences of the example part 1 and 2 actually with this code for the OR case.

xor.py - Worked out as an example using AND,OR and NOT gates.

xor-from-nand.py - Worked out as and example of just using 4 NAND gates to create a XOR gate.

xnor.py - Worked out as an example using AND,OR,NOT and a NAND gates.

xor-linear.py - Worked out using a third input to perceptron which is both of the original x inputs multiplied together, which can be thought of like an AND.
